This directory contains layout files.  

Layout files are xml files that end with the `.layout.xml` file extension.

Layout files contain information about the rows and columns that exist on a given page.  Every Quilt you define (in `res/quilts`) must specify 1 (and only 1) layout to determine what columns it can add compoents to.  

Here is an example layout.xml file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<layout>
	<row id="header">
		<column width="24" id="common-header" />
	</row>
	<row id="main">
		<column width="24" id="main-content" />
	</row>
	<row id="footer">
		<column width="24" id="common-footer" />
	</row>
</layout>
```
This is taken from the default layout named `one-column.layout.xml`.

You can go to the Layouts tab in Lithium Studio to view all the default layouts and can click over to xml view to grab the xml for a given layout if you want to use that as a base.
