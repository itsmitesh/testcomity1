This directory contains controller files.

Controllers contain the Freemarker content portions of endpoints.

All files must have the .ftl extension, and should be readable as freemarker (http://freemarker.org/docs/) which parses as html.
There are no mandatory files in this directory.

See `endpoints/README.md` for more information.
